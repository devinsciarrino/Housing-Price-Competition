# Housing-Price-Competition
This was the Kaggle competition on prediction housing prices. I used random forests model to achieve a final score of 15642.31171
resultiing in competition ranking of 389 out of 5197 entries. Final score is measure in root mean squared error for the prediction. In training the model i tried 3 different forest models with 100, 200 and 300 "trees" respectively, with the optimal mtry being 80. In future competions and work I will look to trying more variation for the amount of tree's and mtry values, aswell as making a validation set in order to tune the hyper parameters. I did not do these on this project because i was trying to learn more about Kaggle's online competions and was more interested in completing it in a timely fashion rather than perfecting the model. Overall I did see this as a success in placing in the top 8 percent of submissions in only my second Kaggle competion.
